The goal is to convert pages from tomshardware to a form usable for printing. Example link: http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/11/19/the_spider_weaves_its_web/

The article is split into 42 pieces. The goal of this project is to merge these 42 pieces into one HTML page which can be sent to printer.

Solution: use wget to download all pieces. Then use perl script to merge the piecs together.
